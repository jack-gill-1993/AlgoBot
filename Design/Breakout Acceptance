# Breakout Acceptance — Bot Recipe

## Inputs

- Price candles for NQ / ES (e.g. 5m or 15m)
- Volume footprint data (delta + imbalances)
- Key levels (resistance zones)
- Trend filter (for example: price above 50 EMA, or bullish Ichimoku cloud)

## Steps for a LONG setup

1. Check that the market is in an UPTREND.
   - Price is above the trend filter (e.g. 50 EMA / cloud).
   - Recent swing highs and lows are stepping UP.

2. Mark a clear RESISTANCE level.
   - Prior swing high or consolidation top.
   - Level has been tested at least 2–3 times.

3. Confirm the BREAKOUT candle.
   - Candle closes ABOVE the resistance level.
   - Delta is POSITIVE.
   - There are clear BUY IMBALANCES in the footprint near the breakout.
   - No sign of heavy absorption at the highs (no huge sell volume capping price).
   - Volume is at least “normal” or higher than the last few candles.

4. Look at the NEXT candle (acceptance check).
   - Price STAYS above the breakout level (no full return back inside the range).
   - Delta is not strongly negative (ideally small positive or neutral).
   - Any pullback is shallow and holds above the level.

5. If steps 1–4 are true:
   - Signal = LONG.
   - Entry:
     - Either at market near the close of the acceptance candle,
     - Or on a small pullback towards the breakout level.
   - Stop loss:
     - Just BELOW the breakout zone (under the level / recent micro swing low).
   - Take profit:
     - First target = 1R–2R (one to two times the risk).
     - Optional: leave part of the position to trail with ATR or swing lows.
